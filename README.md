# Sales Product Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project was created using Power BI as part of a micro-credential program at Sault College. 
The goal of the project is to analyze sales data, identify patterns, and support decision-making 
using data visualization and DAX functions.

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Manipulating and analyzing sales data
- Using DAX and statistical functions
- Identifying outliers in sales data
- Creating visualizations to support decision-making
- Understanding Power BI capabilities

## Analysis Summary (Step 6)
The analysis focuses on identifying sales trends and detecting potential outliers using statistical
methods. Visualizations such as scatter plots and charts were used to understand product
performance better and support data-driven insights.

## Discussion Reflection
This project helped improve my understanding of Power BI, especially working with DAX functions
and data visualization. It strengthened my ability to analyze data and present insights clearly
for decision-making purposes.
